SQL--
--------

DATA--

Data is a rough fact which describes the properties of an entity.

DATABASE--

Database is a place or a medium where we can store the data in a systematic and organised manner.
DBMS(DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM)--
It is a software which is used to maintain and manage the data. We can use some query language to interact with DBMS.
In DBMS data stores in the form of files.

RDBMS--

RDBMS stands for relational database managememt system.
RDBMS is also one of the kind of DBMS software where data will be store in the form of table.
A DBMS software which follows relational model will become RDBMS.
The key important features of RDBMS are security and authorization.
Authorization is a process where the database manager gets imformation about the authorised user.

RELATIONAL MODEL--

Retional model is the technique which was develop by EF Codd.
In relational model data will be stored in the form of table.

EF Codd RULE --

The data enter into cell must be single valued data.
Cell is the smallest unit of the table.
The RDBMS data will be stored in the form of table including meta data.
According to EF Codd rule we can establish the connection between two tables by the help of key attribute.
We can validate the data enter into the table with the help of data type and constraints.

DATA TYPE --

There are 5 type of data type in SQL-
1)CHAR    2)VARCHAR/VARCHAR2    3)NUMBER     4)DATA     5)LOB -- BLOB & CLOB

CHAR --

In CHAR datatype the allowed characters are uppercase "A-Z", lowercase "a-z", digit"0-9", special characters like @, #, *, &.
It is mandatory to enclose CHAR data in single cot('').
syntax -- CHAR(SIZE)
In CHAR datatype the size will describe the maximum number of characters allowed in a perticular coloum.
Here specified size is mandatory. The maximum size of CHAR is 2000.
CHAR datatype follows fixed length memory allocation.

VARCHAR --

In VARCHAR datatype the allowed characters are uppercase "A-Z", lowercase "a-z", digit"0-9", special characters like @, #, *, &, _, $.
It is mandatory to enclose VARCHAR data in single cot('').
syntax -- VARCHAR(SIZE)
In VARCHAR datatype the size will describe the maximum number of characters allowed in a perticular coloum.
Here specified size is mandatory. The maximum size of VARCHAR is 2000.
VARCHAR datatype follows variable length memory allocation.
VARCHAR2 --

VARCHAR2 is an updated version of varchar where size will be increased to 4000.

NUMBER --

NUMBER datatype will help to store numirical values, if we can declare any coloum as number then we can insert any phone no. , serial no. , registration no. ,
etc. according to the requirement of user.

DATE --

DD-MON-YYYY --- 21-JUN-2023
DD-MON-YY  --- 21-JUN-23
We have to use single cot to enclose the DATE datatype,

LOB (LARGE OBJECT) --

1) BLOB --
BLOB is used for storing binary data like images, videos, files, etc. upto 4GB.
2) CLOB --
CLOB is used for storing characters upto 4GB.

CONSTRAINTS --

Constraints are the addition rule assigned to a particular coloum.
If we assign constraints then it is mandatory the data should be satisfied constraint rule. 

There are 5 types of constraints --
1) UNIQUE  2) NOT NULL   3)PRIMARY KEY   4) CHECK   5) FOREIGN

1) UNIQUE -- 
If we assign UNIQUE to a coloum then we can't enter any duplicate values.

2) NOT NULL -- 
If any coloum assign with NOT NULL then we can't enter null values or we can't leave the cell blank.

3) PRIMARY KEY -- 
It is usefull to identify record uniquely from the table.
Primary key is the combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL.
If a coloum assigned with primary key then it doesn't accept any duplicate value or any null value.
We can declare only one primary key inside a table.
Primary key is not mandatory but it is highly recomandate.

CHECK --
CHECK constraints are usefull for additional validation purpose.
We have to assign condition, if the condition satisfied then the value will be stored in the table.

FOREIGN KEY --
It is used to achive relationship between multiple table.
It is not the combination of UNIQUE and NOT NULL.
It can accepted repeated or duplicated values.
A table can contain more than one FOREIGN KEY.
To become foreign key it should be PRIMARY KEY of its own table.

STATEMENTS OF SQL --

There are 5 statements of SQL --
1) DDL (DATA DEFINATION LANGUAGE)
2) DML (DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE)
3) TCL (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE)
4) DCL (DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE)
5) DQL (DATA QUERY LANGUAGE)

DDL --

Q) How to create a table
syntax --
CREATE TABLE TABLENAME
( COLOUMNAME DATATYPE CONSTRAINTS,
  COLOUMNAME DATATYPE CONSTRAINTS,
  COLOUMNAME DATATYPE CONSTRAINTS);
DESC STD1 / DESCRIBE STD1 -- TO DESCRIBE THE SQL
Ex --
CREATE TABLE STD1
( ROLL NUMBER(3) PRIMARYKEY,
  SNAME VARCHAR(10) NOTNULL,
  AGE NUMBER(2) NOTNULL,
  GENDER VARCHAR(1)  );

DQL --

By the help of DQL we can retrive the data from database table.
There are 4 statements of DQL --
1) SELECTION   2) PROJECTION    3) SELECT    4) JOIN

SELECT -- 
SELECT statement of DQL is used for retrive the data.
Q) Write a query to display the details of STD1 table?
Ans) SELECT * FROM STD1;
 
We use * for selecting all the data from database table.
In query 1st FROM claus starts the execution and SELECT claus ends the execution.

Q) WAQTD student name from student table ?
Ans) SELECT SNAME FROM STD1;

Q) WAQTD the student name and gender from student table ?
Ans) SELECT SNAME, GENDER FROM STD1;

Q)WAQTD all the details as well as roll no. of the student ?
Ans) SELECT STD1.*, ROLL FROM STD1;

PROJECTION --

PROJECTION is used for retriving the data from database table only by selecting coloums.
syntax -- SELECT */DISTINCT(COLOUMNAME)/EXPRESSION(ALIAS);

#DISTINCT -- DISTINCT is a key word which will help to remove duplicate values from resultant table.
question --

Q)WAQTD the department number of employee by removing duplicates?
Ans)SELECT DISTINCT DEPTNO FROM EMP;

Q)WAQTD the job and deptno from employee table by removing duplicates?
Ans)SELECT DISTINCT DEPTNO, JOB FROM EMP;

DISTINCT should be used as first executable statement in select claus.
For DISTINCT we can pass coloum name or expression as an argument.
We can pass multiple coloum to distrinct to remove duplicates data from database table by combining coloums.

#EXPRESSION -- EXPRESSION is the combination of operator and operand.

Q)WAQTD the anual salary of employees from emp table?
Ans)SELECT SAL*12 FROM EMP;

Q)WAQTD the salary of employee with 10% hike?
Ans)SELECT SAL+SAL*10/100 FROM EMP;

#ALIAS -- ALIAS is an alternative name which can be provided to any expression or coloum.
ALIAS can be single word or multiple word and enclosed with double cot (" "). As keyword is optional.
ex -- SELECT SAL*12 AS "ANNUAL SAL" FORM EMP;

Q)WAQTD emp name, sal, annual sal from employee table?
Ans)SELECT ENAME,SAL,SAL*12 FROM EMP;

Q)WAQTD name, sal, 1/2 term salary from emp table?
Ans)SELECT ENAME,SAL,SAL*6 FROM EMP;

Q)WAQTD the details of the employees and salary with 50% deduction?
Ans)SELECT EMP.*,SAL-SAL*1/2 FROM EMP;
